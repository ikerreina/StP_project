# StP_project
StP: a web server to predict pathogenesis of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in membrane proteins.

The aim of the project is to create a web server able to predict if a missense mutation in a transmembrane region of a membrane protein is likely to affect the structure and/or function of a protein and consequently being damaging.
